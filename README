In this Project I work throw the book Head First Design Patterns (deutsch:  Entwurfsmuster von Kopf bis Fuss) . This is part of a schoolproject I do to prove that I write better more extensibel software with Clojure.

## Usage

This has only the use to show how Clojure differce from Java and where it is better (or worse).
